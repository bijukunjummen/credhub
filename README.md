# PCF CredHub 

The CredHub server manages secrets like passwords, certificates, ssh keys, rsa keys, strings 
(arbitrary values) and CAs. CredHub provides a REST API to get, set, or generate and securely store
such secrets.
 
See additional repos for more info:

* [credhub-cli](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/credhub-cli) :     command line interface for credhub
* [credhub-release](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/credhub-release) : BOSH release of CredHub server
* [cred-hub-acceptance-tests](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/cred-hub-acceptance-tests) : integration tests written in Go.

## Development Notes

### Starting the server

Start the app: `./gradlew bootRun`

### Running against different databases

CredHub supports MySql, Postgres, and H2. You can change which database is used by
adjusting the spring datasource values in the `application-dev.yml` file. Migrations 
should run automatically during the application startup.

Testing with different databases requires you to set a system property with the profile 
corresponding to your desired database. For example, to test with H2, you'll need to run
the tests with the `-Dspring.profiles.active=unit-test-h2` profile. 

During development, it is helpful to set up different IntelliJ testing profiles that use
the following VM Options:

- `-ea -Dspring.profiles.active=unit-test-h2` for testing with H2
- `-ea -Dspring.profiles.active=unit-test-mysql` for testing with MySQL
- `-ea -Dspring.profiles.active=unit-test-postgres` for testing with Postgres


### Pushing changes

When you've committed a change, run the `ship.sh` command to integrate your work. This
will rebase your changes over any new commits, run all unit tests, run the cli acceptance
tests, and then push your changes if all tests pass.

### To debug while running on a VM:

- Make sure that TCP port 49151 allows inbound connections. This probably means changing an AWS security group. 
- Deploy the code you want to debug
- ssh into the VM
- cd /var/vcap/jobs/credhub
- sudo monit unmonitor credhub
- If credhub is running, kill the process
- sudo vi bin/ctl and add these flags: -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=49151
- sudo bin/ctl start
- In IntelliJ, create a run configuration of foo "Remote" with the IP address of your VM and port number 49151
- Click the "Debug" button.
